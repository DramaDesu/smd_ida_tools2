## Contains
1. ROM files loader
2. Z80 sound drivers loader

## How to compile on Windows
1. Edit paths to your IDA/SDK installation according to your real paths (`IDA_DIR`, `IDA_SDK`)
2. Install `vcpkg` as described in the [Tutorial: Install and use packages with MSBuild in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-msbuild) step 1.
3. Download and unpack IDA Pro QT distro: [qt-5.15.2-full-IDA83.tar.bz2](qt_ida_src_while_original_link_is_dead/qt-5.15.2-full-IDA83.tar.bz2)
4. Install Perl from: https://strawberryperl.com/
5. Edit `build.py` from IDA Pro QT distro. Add: `"-nomake", "examples",` after `"-nomake", "tests",`
6. Install and add to PATH `jom` from: https://ftp.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/download.qt-project.org/official_releases/jom/jom_1_1_4.zip
7. Build IDA Pro QT (using **Visual Studio Developement Command Prompt**): `python build.py -j 16 -v`
8. Compile solution with **Visual Studio 2022** or newer

## How to compile on Linux
1. Edit path to your SDK installation according to your real path `IDA_SDK`
2. Download and unpack IDA Pro QT distro: [qt-5.15.2-full-IDA83.tar.bz2](qt_ida_src_while_original_link_is_dead/qt-5.15.2-full-IDA83.tar.bz2)
3. Edit `build.py` from IDA Pro QT distro. Add: `"-nomake", "examples",` after `"-nomake", "tests",`
4. Build IDA Pro QT: `python3 build.py -j 16 -v`
5. `./build_proto_68k.sh`
6. `./build_proto_z80.sh`
7. `./compile_loaders.sh`
8. `./compile_gensida.sh`
9. `cp ./linux_loaders/* ~/ida-pro-9.x/loaders/`
10. `cp ./linux_gensida/* ~/ida-pro-9.x/plugins/`

## How to use
1. Put files from the `loaders` dir into the corresponding IDA folder
2. Put files from the `plugins` dir into the corresponding IDA folder
3. Open ROM in IDA
4. Choose `GensIDA debugger plugin` or `Z80 debugger plugin` debugger
5. Press `F9` to start a debugging process
6. Run `[wine] gens_68k.exe` or `[wine] gens_z80.exe` from `gens` folder, choose a ROM
7. Debug!

## Available assemblers

## How to produce a compilable asm listing
1. Press `Shift+J` to choose how to mark your data range. Or mark it by yourself using available methods (listed below)
2. Press `File->Produce file->Create LST file...`. Save `.lst` listing file
3. Use any of AS/VASM/ASM68K assemblers to compile your `.lst` file. You can also use `assemble_as.bat`, `assemble_vasm.bat` or `assemble_asm68k.bat` for that

## Data marking methods
All methods are specified like `START_TAG` - `END_TAG` (except `ORG` tag), where `START_TAG` must be specified using **Anterior comment** (`Ins`) at the first line of your data, and `END_TAG` must be inserted using **Posterior comment** (`Shift+Ins`).

Available TAGS:
1. `BIN "relative/path.bin"`. This tag allows you to save some data array (or even code) to the `"relative/path.bin"` during the extraction. It also inserts `binclude "relative/path.bin"` line to your listing.
2. `INC_START "relative/path.inc"` - `INC_END`. The same as the previous item, except it just stores copies all lines between these tags as is and inserts the following line: `include "relative/path.inc"`.
3. `DEL_START` - `DEL_END`. These tags can be used if you want to cut some lines from the resulting asm listing.
4. `ORG $SIZE`. This tag inserts `org $size` directive line in the output.


## How To Set Read Write Breakpoints On `VDP VRAM`, `VDP CRAM`, `VDP VSRAM`

NOTE: this works for DMA operations as well.

Once you are debugging, in the IDA View click 'g' and go to either:
| Memory type | Address | Alternative address |
|-|-|-|
| VRAM | 0x00D00000 | DBG_VDP_VRAM:00D00000 |
| CRAM | 0x00D10000 | DBG_VDP_CRAM:00D10000 |
| VSRAM | 0x00D20000 | DBG_VDP_VSRAM:00D20000 |

Find the address or addresses you want, offsetted from the above. Then select it / them . Right click. a prompt will come up. Click "Add Beakpoint" , or press F2 after selecting.
A "Breakpoint Settings" window will come up. Select either read or write or both under Hardware breakpoint mode and set the size. You can enable other settings like actions etc.

## Debugger in IDA PRO
General Registers can be seen while running the debugger in IDA Pro by going to Debugger -> Debugger Windows -> General Registers.
`D0-D7`, `A0-A7`, `PC`, `SP`, `SR`, `DMA_LEN`, `DMA_SRC` and `VDP_DST` are all shown here

VDP Registers can be seen while running the debugger in IDA pro by doign to Debugger -> Debugger Windows -> VDP Registers

## Launch without debugging

Pass `-nodebug 1` to `gens_xxx.exe`.
